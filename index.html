        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>Túrin was one of the greatest warriors of men in the first age of middle-earth. He was born in Dor-Lomin but after his fathers capture in the battle of unnumbered tears, he was sent to Doriath where he was raised as foster child to King Thingol.</p>
        <p>In Doriath he grew to be a capable fighter and joined the elves in battle against the orcs in the northern marches of Doriath. He fled Doriath at the age of 20 after accidentally killing an elf named Saeros. Beleg the strongbow, a friend of Turins was given leave to search for him and bring him home and took with him the black sword Anlachel.</p>
        <p>After leaving his home in exile, he joined and lead a band of outlaws in the wild. Eventually they found home in Amon Rudh with the petty dwarf Mim until his betrayal brought the orcs to their home and all were killed except for Turin who was taken as prisoner.</p>
        <p>Beleg, along with Gwindor (an elf who had escaped Angband) found Turin bound and unconcious, but in their attempt to free him, Turins foot was pricked by the black sword and he awoke in wrath and slew Beleg with it, only realising who it was once it was too late.</p>
        <P>Having lost all of his men at Amon Rudh and now slain his closest friend, Turin travelled to Nargothrond with Gwindor and here became a leader of the army, where he wileded the black sword (now name Gurthang) and wore the dragon-helm of Dor-Lomin which struck fear into the hearts of the enemy. Tragedy struck Turin once more as Morgoth released a great army of orcs and Glaurung, father of dragons who destroyed Nargothrond and its people were slain or scattered. During the battle, the dragon caught Turins gaze and deceived him into thinking his mother and sister were in trouble. He hadn't seen his mother, Morwen, since his departure from Dor-Lomin who was pregnant with his sister, Nienor at the time.</P>
        <p>Upon arrival in Dor-Lomin, Turin discovered that his homelands were taken over and his people enslaved by the easterlings, men who joined forces with Morgoth. He also discovered that his mother and sister had fled to Doriath. Turin, next travlled to Brethil in search of the elven maiden Finduilas whom he loved and had been captured in the sack of Nargothrond. To his gried however, he learnt that she had been slain by her captors in an attempted rescued by the men of Brethil. He remained here, fighting now with a spear and bow rather than the black sword.</p>
        <p>When his mother and sister learnt of the destruction of Nargothrond, they left Doriath in search of him. During this quest, Nienor came face-to-face with Glaurung who clouded here mind and she forgot everything, even here own name. By chance, she came towards Brethil where she was found in the wild by Turin who brought her home and took care of her. Unknowing her true identity, Nienor was called Niniel and married Turin.</p>
        <p> When it came that Glaurung left Nargothrond, Turin and two willing companions set out to meet the dragons path and slay him. Only Turin made it to the dragon, where he stabbed into his stomach with the black sword and poisonous blood flooded from the wyrms body as he died. Turin was knoacked unconcious by the poison, and was seemingly dead. In this time, Niniel had followed Turin and found her beloved dead by the dragons body, who spoke to her and released his spell, bringing back all of her memory and in turn she threw herself from the cliff edge into the deadly waters below and was never seen again. Upon awakening, Turin returned towards Brethil where he met Brandir who told him what had happend and in his anger Turin slew him. Turin then case him self upon Gurthang and requested of the blade that it take his life, the sword killed its master and broke beneath his body.</p>
